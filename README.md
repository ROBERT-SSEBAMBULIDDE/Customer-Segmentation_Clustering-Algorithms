# Customer-Segmentation_Clustering-Algorithms
# Overview
This project focuses on creating a robust customer segmentation model using clustering algorithms to gain actionable insights into customer behavior. By employing unsupervised learning techniques, we aim to group customers based on shared characteristics, allowing for targeted and personalized strategies in marketing, product offerings, and customer engagement.
Sure, here are the general steps to follow in order to create a customer segmentation model:

# 1-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
We should start by understanding our data. EDA would include looking at the variables (columns), missing values, outliers, and distributions of variables. In EDA, we can also explore the relationships between different variables in the dataset.
Function Calls: `df_1.info()`, `df_1.describe()`, `df_1.isnull().sum()`

# 2-Data Cleaning: 
In this step, we would deal with missing values, duplicates, and outliers. The approach here would depend on our EDA. We may choose to fill missing values, drop them, or do nothing, depending on the situation.
Function Calls: `df_1.drop_duplicates()`, `df_1.fillna(method)`

# 3-Feature Engineering: 
Involves creating Customer Monetary Value, Frequency, and Recency (RFM) features. This is often used in customer segmentation. Additionally, we might need to convert date-time attributes to a format that can be interpreted by a machine learning model.
Function Calls: `pd.to_datetime(df_1['InvoiceDate'])`, `df_1['InvoiceDate'].dt.to_period('M')`, `df_1.groupby('CustomerID')`

# 4-Data Preprocessing: 
This includes standardizing or normalizing the dataset. Most clustering algorithms are sensitive to the scale of the data, so this step is crucial.
Function Calls: `from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler`, `scaler.fit_transform(df_1)`

# 5-Model Building: 
Building the Customer Segmentation Model using a clustering algorithm (like K-means, Hierarchical clustering, or DBSCAN).
Function Calls: `from sklearn.cluster import KMeans`, `KMeans(n_clusters=k).fit(df_1)`

# 6-Evaluation: 
Determining the optimal number of clusters (using methods like Elbow Method, Silhouette Score). Inspecting the clusters and interpreting the results.
Function Calls: `from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score`, `silhouette_score(df_1, kmeans.labels_)`

# 7-Visualization: 
Visualizing the clusters can provide insights. We could use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of our data to two dimensions which can be plotted.

   Function Calls: `from sklearn.decomposition import PCA`, `PCA(n_components=2).fit_transform(df_1)`

These steps will give you a basic structure to start with. The specific methods and techniques you decide to use can vary depending on the dataset and the business problem at hand.
